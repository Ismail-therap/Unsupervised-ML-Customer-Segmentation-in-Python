# Customer Segmentation

### Problem Statement:

This is a practical project assigned by one of my freelancing client and he gave me the authorization to publish the code and part of the data without disclouse the client details. 

So, the client was interested to cluster the customers using some of the attributes. In other word he wanted to classify his customers in relevent segment to apply his business logics to gain the optimal profit from them by doing advertisement. 

### Methods:

I used 4 different clustering techniqes: 

1. K-means clustering
2. Hierarchical clustering
3. Density-based spatial clustering of applications with nois (DBSCAN)
4. Gaussian Mixed Model
